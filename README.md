# Cognizant: Assignment 3

## Overview

This repository contains code for an assignment issued by Cognizant.

## Scenario 1: Client-Side Scripting

Implement client-side logic to retrieve the email and mobile phone details 
for the primary contact linked to the account record. Using the client scripting 
API, you'll manipulate the form controls to display this data on the case form.

## Scenario 2: Power Apps Plugin

Create a plug-in that prevents the creation of a new case if there is an active 
case with the same related account or contact. If a case is found, the plug-in 
will block the creation of this new case. Use the plug-in trace log to see trace 
message from the plug-in.
